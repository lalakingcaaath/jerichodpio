        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
          Pursuing a Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. I am an
          aspiring Front-End Developer, and curious about App Development. When
          I was in SHS I took the ABM course, because what I wanted to pursue in
          college at that time was marketing. A year later in the course, I
          learned that marketing was not for me. So when I was applying for a
          course at PUP I chose Computer Engineering, since I grew up with
          computers and was comfortable with it.

        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I play games, watch anime, kdrama during my free time. And if I feel
          productive, I go to Udemy and youtube to watch free online courses,
          mostly about Web Dev. I am currently learning JavaScript, Web3 and UI
          Design.

          <h3>R.U Hacking?</h3>
          <p>
            At the R.U Hacking? Hackathon 2021, we chose to solve citrix
            challenge. To create a solution one or more challenges faced by
            organizations or employees that will have a positive impact on
            employee experience. We were supposed to make our solution as an
            app, but none of us have any experience on app development and we
            wanted to stick to what we knew, so we made a webpage on how the app
            should work.
